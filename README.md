# purescript-web-router

A basic pushstate router for React with support for asynchronous routing logic. I recommend [routing-duplex](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-routing-duplex) for easy parsing and printing.

For a basic example see [here](https://github.com/robertdp/purescript-web-router-example/tree/master/src).

## How to use with Spago

Install with `$ spago install web-router` (coming soon)
